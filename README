This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2555

A colorful, dark color scheme, inspired by ir_black (http://blog.infinitered.com/entries/show/6) and twilight (vimscript #1677).

Designed primarily for a graphical Vim, but includes support for 256, 88, 16, and 8 color terminals. On 16 or 8 color terminals, set the "black" color to a dark grey for best results.
